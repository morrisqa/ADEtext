<p>It is reasonable to ask why we restrict ourselves to single first order ordinary differential equations.  There are two reasons: first, as we observed earlier, every differential equation of order <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> can be rewritten as a system of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> first-order equations.  Working with systems, while not that different from single equations, does require a bit more knowledge of linear algebra.  So, instead of working with systems, we will work with single equations.  For those interested in systems, the good news is that not much changes in many results (or their associated proofs) from the single equation case.</p>
