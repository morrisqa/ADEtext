<p>This is great news!  We have shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exabsf.html" title="Example 1.2.4">Example 1.2.4</a> that (1) a solution exists (by finding a solution directly) and (2) that the solution we found is the only solution!  Additionally, the work provides a roadmap for proceeding toward a more general proof of a uniqueness theorem.  Before moving on, consider how the work in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exabsf.html" title="Example 1.2.4">Example 1.2.4</a> would change if the right-hand side of the differential equation were changed from <span class="process-math">\(|y(t)|\)</span> to a more general <span class="process-math">\(f(t,y)\text{.}\)</span> While we would not know whether a solution existed for the more general equation, we could still endeavor to show that if we have two solutions, say <span class="process-math">\(z(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(w(t)\text{,}\)</span> then we must have <span class="process-math">\(z(t)=w(t)\text{.}\)</span> Virtually all of our work would proceed the same, until we reached our use of the reverse triangle inequality.  In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exabsf.html" title="Example 1.2.4">Example 1.2.4</a>, we used</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/exabsf.html ./knowl/exabsf.html ./knowl/exabsf.html">
\begin{equation*}
\left| | w(t)| - |z(t)| \right| \le \left| w(t)-z(t) \right|,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">the reverse triangle inequality.  Now, however, we needed</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/exabsf.html ./knowl/exabsf.html ./knowl/exabsf.html">
\begin{equation*}
\left| f(t,w(t))-f(t,z(t)) \right| \le K \left|w(t)-z(t)\right|.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Note that the inclusion of an additional constant <span class="process-math">\(K&gt;0\)</span> will not affect our work, since it will simply be included in the exponent when Gronwall's Inequality is applied.</p>
