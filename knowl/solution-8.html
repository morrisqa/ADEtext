<p>Since the differential equation <span class="process-math">\(y''=y\)</span> is linear with constant coefficients, we could consider its characteristic equation, find the roots, and use those to write down a solution.  The initial conditions would then be used to find unknown constants.</p>
<p>For this problem, however, such a method is likely unnecessary.  We may observe that we know two linearly independent functions, namely <span class="process-math">\(y_1(x)=\sin(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_2(x)=\cos(x)\text{,}\)</span> which satisfy <span class="process-math">\(y''=y\text{.}\)</span>  Hence, any solution must be of the form <span class="process-math">\(y(t)=c_1y_1(t) + c_2y_2(t)\text{,}\)</span> and the initial conditions are again used to find the unknown constants <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_2\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>In this case, the reader should find that <span class="process-math">\(y(t)=3\sin(t)\)</span> is a solution.  What is harder to show is that this is the <em class="emphasis">only</em>  solution.</p>
