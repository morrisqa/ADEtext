<p>In this chapter, we will recount some results dealing with initial value problems which you are likely to have encountered in a first course in differential equations.  As happens in math, the very powerful theorems we are able to prove about the existence and uniqueness of solutions to initial value problems make them rather dull to study.  Nevertheless, we will take advantage of their nice properties later own when studying more difficult types of problems.</p>
