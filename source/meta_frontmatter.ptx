      I found my first course in differential equations quite boring.  Classifying types of differential equations and learning algorithms for generating closed form expressions of their solutions lacked the creativity and problem solving I saw in other areas of math.  This book is written to dispell that myth, that an interested undergraduate or beginning graduate student might see that the field of differential equations is interesting, connected broadly to other areas of mathematics, and worth thinking about deeply.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book is written to be understood by undergraduate students.  The only suggested prerequisites are multivariable calculus and linear algebra, though experience with proofs, particularly proofs appearing in real analysis, would be helpful.  Examples may, from time to time, draw connections to other areas of mathematics which you have not yet studied.  This is not a shortcoming, or the readers or the author, but rather a feature: consider it an exciting preview of what's to come.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike many differential equations texts written for undergraduates, which are focused on differential equations as practiced in allied fields (physics, engineering, chemistry, etc.), we will study differential equations as they are studied by mathematicians.  While some applications may be discussed, the primary motivation for studying differential equations will be for their own interesting mathematical properties.
